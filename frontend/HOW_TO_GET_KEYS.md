# üîë How to Get All Required Keys

This guide will walk you through getting every key and configuration value you need to run your Sora Guesser frontend.

## Overview

You need **3 main keys** to run the application:

1. ‚úÖ **OpenAI API Key** - For image generation
2. ‚öôÔ∏è **Solana Program ID** - Your deployed smart contract
3. ü™ô **Token Mint Address** - Your custom token

---

## 1. ü§ñ Getting Your OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Create an OpenAI Account

1. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
2. Sign up with your email or continue with Google/Microsoft
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Add Payment Method

1. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview)
2. Click **"Add payment method"**
3. Add a credit/debit card
4. **Note**: You'll need at least $5-10 credit to start

**Pricing**: DALL-E 3 costs approximately:

- $0.040 per 1024√ó1024 standard quality image
- $0.080 per 1024√ó1024 HD quality image

### Step 3: Generate API Key

1. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Click **"Create new secret key"**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Sora Guesser App")
4. Click **"Create secret key"**
5. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the key immediately! You won't be able to see it again.

Your API key will look like:

```
sk-proj-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP
```

### Step 4: Add to Environment

In your `frontend/.env.local` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes

- **NEVER** commit your API key to git
- **NEVER** expose it in client-side code
- Keep it in `.env.local` (which is gitignored)
- The key is only used server-side in API routes

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Your Solana Program ID

The Program ID is the address of your deployed smart contract on Solana.

### Option A: Deploy Your Program (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites

```bash
# Make sure you have these installed
solana --version
anchor --version
```

#### Step 1: Build Your Program

```bash
# From your project root
cd /path/to/sora_guesser
anchor build
```

#### Step 2: Get a Solana Wallet (If you don't have one)

```bash
# Generate a new keypair
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/id.json
```

#### Step 3: Get Some SOL for Deployment

**For Devnet (Free - Recommended for Testing):**

```bash
# Switch to devnet
solana config set --url devnet

# Get your wallet address
solana address

# Request airdrop (2 SOL)
solana airdrop 2

# Check balance
solana balance
```

**For Mainnet (Real SOL Required):**

```bash
# Switch to mainnet
solana config set --url mainnet-beta

# You'll need to buy SOL and transfer to your wallet
```

#### Step 4: Deploy

```bash
# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy

# The output will show:
# Program Id: Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS
```

**Copy the Program ID** from the output!

#### Step 5: Add to Environment

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID=Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS
```

### Option B: Use Existing Program ID

If you already deployed, you can find your Program ID in:

1. **Anchor.toml** file:

```toml
[programs.devnet]
sora_guesser = "Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS"
```

2. **Or run**:

```bash
solana address -k target/deploy/sora_guesser-keypair.json
```

## 3. ü™ô Getting Your Token Mint Address

The Token Mint is the address of your custom SPL token.

### Step 1: Make Sure Program is Deployed

You need your program deployed first (see section 2 above).

### Step 2: Create Your Token

**From your project root**, run:

```bash
# This will create a new SPL token
npm run create-token
```

Or manually:

```bash
# Navigate to scripts
cd scripts

# Run the token creation script
npx esrun create-token-mint.ts
```

### Step 3: Copy the Token Mint Address

The script will output:

```
‚úÖ Token mint created: 7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU
```

**Copy this address!**

### Step 4: Initialize the Game

After creating the token, you need to initialize the game state:

```bash
# From project root
anchor test
```

Or manually call the initialize function.

### Step 5: Add to Environment

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_MINT=7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU
```

**Also update** in `frontend/components/TokenBalance.tsx` line 10:

```typescript
const TOKEN_MINT = new PublicKey(
  "7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU"
);
```

## 4. üìù Complete .env.local Example

After getting all keys, your `frontend/.env.local` should look like:

```env
# OpenAI API Key (for image generation)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789

# Solana Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet

# Program ID (from anchor deploy)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID=Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS

# Token Mint Address (from create-token script)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_MINT=7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU

# Custom RPC Endpoint (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_ENDPOINT=
```

## 5. üîç Verification Checklist

Before running your app, verify:

- [ ] OpenAI API key starts with `sk-`
- [ ] OpenAI account has payment method added
- [ ] Solana program is deployed (`anchor deploy` completed)
- [ ] Program ID is in Anchor.toml
- [ ] Token mint is created (`npm run create-token` completed)
- [ ] Game state is initialized (run `anchor test`)
- [ ] All keys are in `frontend/.env.local`
- [ ] Token mint is updated in `TokenBalance.tsx`

## 6. üß™ Testing Your Setup

### Test OpenAI Integration

```bash
# From frontend directory
cd frontend

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and try viewing an image.

### Test Wallet Connection

1. Install Phantom wallet browser extension
2. Create/import a wallet
3. Switch to devnet in Phantom settings
4. Get devnet SOL: Visit [https://faucet.solana.com/](https://faucet.solana.com/)
5. Connect wallet on your app

### Test Token Balance

If you see your token balance displayed, everything is working!

## 8. üîê Security Best Practices

### API Keys

‚úÖ **DO:**

- Keep keys in `.env.local`
- Use environment variables
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use separate keys for dev/prod

‚ùå **DON'T:**

- Commit keys to git
- Share keys publicly
- Use same key across projects
- Expose keys in client code

### Wallet Security

‚úÖ **DO:**

- Use a separate wallet for development
- Keep seed phrases secure
- Test on devnet first
- Verify all transactions

‚ùå **DON'T:**

- Use main wallet for testing
- Share private keys
- Skip transaction verification
- Deploy to mainnet without testing

## 9. üêõ Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"

**Problem**: API key not set or incorrect

**Solution**:

1. Check `.env.local` exists in `frontend/` directory
2. Verify key starts with `sk-`
3. Restart dev server after adding key
4. Check for typos

### "Program not found"

**Problem**: Program ID incorrect or not deployed

**Solution**:

1. Run `anchor deploy`
2. Copy exact Program ID from output
3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID`
4. Restart dev server

### "Token account not found"

**Problem**: Token mint address incorrect or not created

**Solution**:

1. Run `npm run create-token` from project root
2. Copy the Token Mint address
3. Update both `.env.local` AND `TokenBalance.tsx`
4. Create a token account for your wallet

### "Insufficient funds"

**Problem**: No SOL in wallet

**Solution**:

- **Devnet**: Get free SOL from [faucet.solana.com](https://faucet.solana.com/)
- **Mainnet**: Buy SOL and transfer to wallet
